    "## 1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is a very simple machine learning model. It was widely used in the 1960s-1980s for building expert systems. It is widely known and used in many companies to facilitate decision making and risk analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given dataset with many features, the decision starts by selecting one of these features (the most appropriate and relevant one, following some defined criteria) ; if this is not sufficient, another feature is selected, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "At their creation, the rules were introduced manually, for this reason this model lost its popularity after the 1980s, but the appearance of mathematical methods for building decision trees brings this model back into the battle of machine learning (ML) algorithms. There are several ML algorithms for building decision trees. So far in this lab, we will learn about :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)** [[JR Quinlan, 1986](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00116251.pdf)]: It was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. It can be applied only on nominal features. It is used for ranking.\n",
    "- **C4.5** [[JR Quinlan, 1993](https://books.google.fr/books?hl=fr&lr=&id=b3ujBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=C4.+5:+Programs+for+machine+learning&ots=sR7pRTJuC2&sig=hmtbed3-eUljdUvf6eoM2vfrbHQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=C4.%205%3A%20Programs%20for%20machine%20learning&f=false)] : an extension of ID3 by Ross Quinlan. It can be applied to all types of features. It is used for classification.\n",
    "- **C5.0** [[JR Quinlan, 2004](https://www.rulequest.com/see5-info.html)] : a commercial extension of C4.5, again by Ross Quinlan.\n",
    "- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)** [Breiman et al. , 1984](Refrence) : like C4.5 but uses other metrics. Also, the algorithm supports regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The general algorithm for creating a decision tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the best feature in the training data set.\n",
    "2. Divide the training data into subsets containing the possible values of the best feature.\n",
    "3. Recursively generate new decision trees using the subsets of data created.\n",
    "4. When the data can no longer be classified, stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Benefits\n",
    "- They are simple to understand and interpret. \n",
    "- The decision trees can be visualised. Also, the results obtained can be easily explained.\n",
    "- They can work on data with lightwheith preprocessing of data e.g., they do not need data normalisation.\n",
    "- They accept both numerical and nominal data. Other learning algorithms are specialised in one type of data.\n",
    "- They perform well even if their assumptions are somewhat violated by the actual model from which the data was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Limitations\n",
    "- They can be as complex, they do not generalise well (they generally tend to over-fit the data); this can be fixed by setting the minimum number of samples in the leaves and the maximum depth of the tree.\n",
    "- They can be unstable because of variations in the data.\n",
    "- There are some concepts that are a bit difficult to learn from decision trees. They are not easy to express, for example: XOR operation.\n",
    "- They can be biased to the dominant class. So you have to balance the data before training the system.\n",
    "- It is not guaranteed that the optimal decision tree will be found."
