= On file encoding

Plain text files can be encoded in different ways. The historical
encoding is the 7 bit ASCII encoding.

This early version of ASCII may encode symbols such as uppercase
letters, lowercase letters, digits, punctuation signs and regular
mathematical operators symbols. It is not possible, however, to encode
accented characters.

Later, ASCII has been extended to use 8 bits, so it can encode ...
extended characters, including accented characters such as `é`, `è` or
even `ç`.
However, 8 bits (256 single values) aren't enough to encode all of the
characters from all of the languages in the world and the 128 extended
characters were used for various purposes depending on the ASCII
flavours.
Some other encodings were introduced to fill the gap, one of them being
Unicode.
One of the Unicode flavour, UTF-8, is the most used encoding at the time
of the writing of this document. It is partially compatible with ASCII
and may represent way more characters.

`file` is a command you can use to determine the type of a file. Thus,
you can get information about its encoding, if the file is a text file.
You simply need to provide it with the name of one or more files.

Get information from the files of the current directory and from those from
the previous room, but without __moving__ from here. Remember that
directories are files too!
Do all the files in the directories you have discovered so far have the
same encoding?
