= Getting help on command usage

All usual commands are thoroughly documented.

They either have online help (often accessible via the `-h` or `--help`
option), or a man page, or both.

The man pages are organized into sections. Most of the commands seen
here are documented in section 1.

To access the manual for a command, simply use the `man`, passing as a
parameter the name of the command of which you want to get the manual.
That's a lot of __commands__ but, after all, that's what this course is
all about!

Some of the manual pages are extremely large.
To make it easier to find your way around, there is always a short
description of the command at the beginning of the manual page (the NAME
paragraph), followed by its various invocation methods (the SYNOPSIS
paragraph).
Finally, you can search for text with the `/` command when reading a
manual.

Funnily enough, the `man` command itself has a man page in which you can
find the description of all the sections!

== Info

For the sake of completeness, we should mention the existence, for some
years now of an alternative documentation system.

The `info` command gives access to the equivalent of a book in which all
commands are documented.
The content of this documentation is often identical to that of the
manual pages, but sometimes has more detail.
Navigating through the pages of this book is however laborious.

== Internet

Finally, it is sometimes tempting to get the documentation for a command
by searching the Internet.
However, we discourage this practice.
Indeed, commands evolve and, from one system to another, a same command
may have huge differences in behavior and accept different options.
The only valid documentation is therefore the one that is provided with
the command when it is installed in the operating system.
