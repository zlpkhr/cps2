= Summary

Welcome to level 2!

You now know the following basic but powerful commands:

 * `ls`         :            list the content of the current directory
 * `cat file`   :                         display the content of `file`
 * `cd dir`     :                    set the current directory to `dir`
 * `cd ..`      :                  move up one level in the filesystem
 * `pwd`        : print out the absolute path of the current directory
 * `file f`     :                        display information about `f`
 * `man command`:                       display the `command` man page
 * `less file`  :  display the content of `file` and move around in it

In this level you will learn to use these commands in depth.

But by the way, do you know what commands you have typed so far?
The `history` __command__ should tell you!
