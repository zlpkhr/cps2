= Process management

Every time you launch a program, whether using the command line interface
or the graphical interface, a new process is created by the system.

This process, bound to a specific user, uses system resources: memory
and CPU.

Therefore, on a Unix system, it is possible to monitor running
processes. You may use one of the two commands below:

`top`:: an interactive program that provides a dynamic real-time view of
your running system.

`ps`:: displays information about a selection of the active processes.
Lots of options makes `ps` a highly versatile utility.

Use `top` to monitor the activity of your system (`q` to quit). What
is the total amount of memory available on your system? How many
processors (CPUs) does your system have?

List the running processes:

. first using `ps`;
. then using `ps -u <user> u` (replace `<user>` with your actual user
name);
. finally using `ps -efal`.
