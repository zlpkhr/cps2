Using the Shell it is possible to search the filesystem for files (and
find them!) matching various criteria.

This is the job of `find`. Give it a directory where to start the search
and it will look for files and/or directories matching some criteria in
this directory and all the subsequent directories too.

The syntax of the `find` command is quite unusual and may seem
complicated at first glace (it is indeed!). However, it is possible to
make some quick search when you get the rough idea.

Below are some examples of usage of this command.

Search the `/etc` directory for files and directories whose name contain
the `_` character:
$> find /etc -name '*_*'

Search, starting from the current directory, for all the files (and only
files) whose name end with `.txt`:
$> find . -type f -name '*.txt'

Search, starting from the current directory, for all the files (and only
files) whose name end with `.txt` or `.me`:
$> find . -type f -name '*.txt' -o -name '*.me'

Print out the name of all the sub directories of the current directory:
$> find . -type d


`find` accepts a lot more of criteria! Read its manual page (section 1)
