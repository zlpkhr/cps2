= Now starts your real journey


Upon entering this room, you are blinded with an intense light: you just
found the way out and are getting back to the surface!

Your wanderings through this little maze now ends. However, you realize
you learned a lot. Now, you know how to:

* get your position in a filesystem and move around it (`pwd`, `cd`,
`ls`)
* read a text file (`cat`, `less`)
* get informations on files and directories (`file`, `ls`)
* move/rename a file or a directory (`mv`)
* get manuals for commands (`man`)
* get the list of all the commands you recently typed (`history`)
* copy files (`cp`)
* remove files (`rm`)
* create directories (`mkdir`)
* remove directories (`rmdir`)
* manage running processes on your system (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)

Now, all other commands are at your fingertips. You will be able to
work more efficiently, creating scripts and automating tasks.
