= Create processes!

We want you to create several CPU hungry processes, that will execute
simultaneously on your computer. To do do, you will create several
terminal windows. This is possible only if you use a native Linux or
a native MacOS. If you use WSL on Windows, you will have to use a
__terminal multiplexer__ like `screen` or `tmux`. Instructions on how to
use `tmux` are given at the end of this document.

. Create three more terminal windows (for a total of four).
. In the first one (or the largest one) execute the `top` utility.
. In the second one, copy the following one-liner (mind the spaces):
+
----
$> while [ 1 ]; do :; done
----
+
. Check for changes in the `top` window. What do you notice?
. In the third window, launch the same one-liner again.
. What does `top` display? Is the total percentage of CPU usage
consistent with what you might expect?

It would be nice now to stop all these greedy processes...
Check the next room to learn more about it.

== Using Tmux

`tmux` is a __terminal multiplexer__. It is able to create several
__windows__ inside a single screen. It can then create several
__panes__ inside each window.

You can control `tmux` several ways, the main ones being with keystrokes
and special hotkeys or with command line arguments.

As it may takes some time to get used to this utility, you will use the
following command to launch `tmux` with 4 pre-created panes: one on the
left hand side, the other three evenly distributed on the right hand
side of the terminal window. The pane on the left is ideal for `top`
hosting as it should be the largest one.

----
$> tmux new \; \split-window -h \; \split-window -v \; \split-window -v \; \select-layout main-vertical
----

Spaces are mandatory, as well as backslashes.

Once all the shells are launched inside each pane, you can move from
one pane to another with the following key sequences:

. [Ctrl+B] then [left_arrow] to move to the pane on the left of the current pane
. [Ctrl+B] then [right_arrow] to move to the pane on the right of the current pane
. [Ctrl+B] then [up_arrow] to move to the pane above the current pane
. [Ctrl+B] then [down_arrow] to move to the pane below the current pane

You can close a pane by quitting the shell inside it, using the [Ctrl+D]
shortcut or typing `exit`.
