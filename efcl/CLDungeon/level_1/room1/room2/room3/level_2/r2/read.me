= Hidden files?

What if everything was not visible at first sight?
Operating systems of the Unix family consider files beginning with the
`.` (dot) character hidden and the `ls` command does not display them by
default.

To tell `ls` to display them, you must pass it a special option.

Read the `ls` man page to find out what this option is and therefore
discover your next destination.
