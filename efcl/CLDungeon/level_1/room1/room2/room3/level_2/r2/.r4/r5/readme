= A detailed view

It is possible to get more information about files and directories using
the `ls` command.
With its `-l` option it gives a detailed view of what's in a diretory in
which you can see, amongst other things, the size of the files in bytes
and it's creation date.

Revisit some rooms to see the detailed information of each file and
directory there.

Of course, it is possible to combine options of a single command ...
For example, you may want to list files by their creation time with the
`-t` option, and reverse the order with the `-r` option.
This would be the following command: `ls -tr`.
You may also want a __long__ listing ordered by reverse date!
