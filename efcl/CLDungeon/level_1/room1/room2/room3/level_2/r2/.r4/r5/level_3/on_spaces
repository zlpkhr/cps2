= Issue about spaces in file names

It is possible to use the ` ` (space) character in files and directories
names, even tho this is discouraged (it raises a lot of concerns with
commands, scripts, etc.)

However, you may still want to use it.
To do so, you could whether enclose the entire name in double quotes,
or __protect__ (precede) each space with the escape character `\`
(backslash).

For example, you can move to the directory `room 1` using one of the
following commands:

. cd "room 1"
. cd room\ 1
