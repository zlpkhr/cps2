= Shell internal commands

Most commands are system commands, i.e. they are separate programs that
the command interpreter (in this case the Bash shell) will execute on
your request.
You can write such commands yourself!

Some commands however are internal to the shell, the so called
"builtins".
You hav already been using one of tyhem without even knowing it: `cd`.

These internal commands are described in a separate man page:
`builtins(7)`.
