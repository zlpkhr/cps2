= Moving freely inside the filesystem

Using the 'cd' command you can move from a directory to another but
only from the root fo the leaves.

So? Is it impossible to move backward?

Of course, you can move to a directory higher in the filesystem giving
its absolute path from the root. But this may become a long and tedious
process!
That's why it is more advisable to use the special directory `..`
(double dot).
It exists everywhere and always refers to the parent directory of the
current directory.

`..` even exists at the root of the filesystem, but obviously you can't
go back any further than the root of the filesystem.

This special directory is used to move around inside the filesystem but
may also be used to express relative paths.
